/**
 * Example 2: You are given a binary string s (a string
 * containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0"
 * and flip it to a "1". What is the length of the longest
 * substring achievable that contains only "1"?
 *
 * For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5.
 * If you perform the flip at index 2, the string becomes
 * 1111100111.
